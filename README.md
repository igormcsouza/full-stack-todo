# FullStack Todo

Many times, when I'm coding my projects, I found myself forgetting some specific
steps to build something, or a snippet, or something very useful which is done
just sometimes. Thinking of it, I came up with an idea, to create an entire
project to hold all those pieces of code, such as github actions sintax,
database connections and so on.

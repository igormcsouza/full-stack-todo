### Backend - Flask

The service I choose to host the backend was the Heroku! It is very limited, but
for this purpose it will suite just fine!

There is an Actions prepared and very good for this, go to this
[link](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-heroku#env-file) for
more information on the matter.

In order to work fine, you'll need to get you _HEROKU API KEY_ on the account
settings. Add this on the secrets, and should be great.

The application is running on https://full-stack-todo-bknd.herokuapp.com/
